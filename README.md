Thanks to Denny Britz for this code: [https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf), which we adapted for some of the workshop sections.

Thanks also to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), for allowing us to use some post data for a training corpus.
