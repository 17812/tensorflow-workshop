# Run a simple linear classification version of MNIST

In this section we'll run and take a look at a linear classification version of the 'MNIST' task.
It's a good illustration of a common pattern for creating and training a model in TensorFlow, and we'll walk through the code for it.

The python script for this section is here: [`mnist_simple.py`](./mnist_simple.py).
Run it as follows.  Make sure you're in your python virtual environment (unless you're running in a Docker container):

```shell
$ python mnist_simple.py
```
