# Create a small TensorFlow graph

In this section we'll create and run a simple TensorFlow graph that does matrix multiplication.

This is a good way to check that everything in your installation is working okay, and lets you get a feel for creating a graph, defining inputs, and running it in a session.

[** TBD. Include small a exercise: have them add an operation to the graph that adds m3 to itself, and run the graph to get that result instead.
